              My approach is direct and impact-driven: identify repetitive processes, design intelligent systems, and
              automate them at scale. Every system I build is designed with scalability, clarity, and long-term
              usability in mind.
            </p>

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              I work with founders, startups, and organizations that want to move beyond manual workflows and build the
              next generation of intelligent systems. The goal is not just automation — it's transformation.
